# Cogniscient required features

This file is the source of truth for what the app must do. Changes to
behaviour should update this file in the same commit. No drift!

## Core workflow

1. **Search**: query the Earth Search STAC API
   (https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1, collection sentinel-2-l2a)
   for the current map view, with a date range (default: last 30 days) and
   a max cloud cover filter (default: 50%). Searching requires a minimum
   zoom level (8) to avoid huge result sets.
   - **Jump to a place**: a debounced (300ms) autocomplete box above the
     date range, forward-geocoding via Nominatim's `/search` endpoint
     (`searchPlaces()` in `geocode.js` — same silent-failure contract as
     the existing reverse-geocode used for download filenames). Up/down
     cycles results, enter or click picks one and `fitBounds`es the map to
     it; the map's existing `moveend` handler re-triggers the STAC search.
     Results float over the rest of the panel rather than pushing it down.
2. **Draw a box**: the user draws a rectangle on the map to define the
   export area. A stray click (zero-size box) cancels instead of drawing.
3. **Pick a day**: results are grouped by acquisition day. Each day shows:
   - mean cloud cover (%) across that day's scenes (whole-footprint value)
   - coverage (%): how much of the drawn box is covered by the union of
     that day's footprints
   - a dropdown toggle showing the scene count; expanding it lists each
     contributing STAC item (id + its own cloud cover %), preserving list
     scroll position across the toggle. Hovering an item row highlights just
     that item's footprint on the map (white outline, drawn above the
     selected-day highlight); clicking opens the item's canonical STAC JSON
     (its `self` link) in a new tab.
4. **Preview**: a mosaicked RGB preview streams from the COGs and is shown
   as an image overlay on the map, georeferenced inside the drawn box.
5. **Visualise** (one panel, combining band/index selection and look-tuning
   — they're one "how the pixels are computed and shown" concern):
   - A preset dropdown picks the visualisation mode and its band mapping in
     one step: True colour RGB, False colour NIR-R-G, NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI,
     NDWI, NDMI, NDRE, NBR, or Single band. Per-mode pickers underneath
     allow full customisation (three band selects for RGB, one for single
     band, two — "A"/"B" — for a custom index). Hand-editing a picker
     switches the preset label to "Custom" without changing mode. Changing
     bands, or the mode itself, refetches. Picking a preset also resets the
     Look sliders (and colour map) to defaults sensible for that mode;
     hand-edited bands do not.
     - `vizMode` is one of:
       - `rgb` — three bands composited straight into R/G/B (default: true
         colour red/green/blue).
       - `single` — one band, shown as grayscale (r = g = b = band value).
       - `index` — normalized difference of two bands, `(a - b) / (a + b)`,
         shown as grayscale. A pixel needs real data in *both* source bands
         to count as valid — an index value of exactly 0 is a real
         measurement, not nodata, so it isn't dropped like an all-zero RGB
         pixel would be. Index presets and their band pairs:
         - NDVI (vegetation) = (nir-red)/(nir+red)
         - NDBI (built-up) = (swir16-nir)/(swir16+nir)
         - MNDWI (water) = (green-swir16)/(green+swir16)
         - NDWI (water, McFeeters) = (green-nir)/(green+nir)
         - NDMI (vegetation moisture) = (nir-swir16)/(nir+swir16)
         - NDRE (red edge / chlorophyll) = (nir-rededge1)/(nir+rededge1)
         - NBR (burn severity) = (nir-swir22)/(nir+swir22)
   - Below the band pickers: vmin / vmax / gamma sliders, never
     auto-overridden by fetches — only a preset change resets them.
     Range/step adapts to `vizMode`: 0–15000 (step 50) for `rgb`/`single`
     reflectance DN, -1–1 (step 0.01) for `index`. For `single`/`index`
     only, a colour-map picker sits directly below the band pickers (8
     options: Grayscale, Greens, Reds, Blues, Viridis, and three diverging
     ramps — Red-Yellow-Green, Red-Blue, Brown-Teal) and recolours the same
     stretched value, with a "Reverse" checkbox beside its label that flips
     which end of the stretch maps to which end of the ramp (works for
     Grayscale too, since that's the same code path with no LUT applied);
     `rgb` mode has no colour map (it already has 3 real bands) and ignores
     `viz.colormap`/`viz.colormapReversed` even if set. Repaints reuse the
     cached pixel data; no refetch.
6. **Download**: export the preview as PNG, JPG, or TIF from cached data (no
   refetch), named
   `cogniscient-<day>-<bands>-<width>px-<place>.<ext>` where `<bands>`
   describes what's actually in the image — `rgb-<r>-<g>-<b>`,
   `single-<band>`, or `index-<a>-<b>` — and `<place>` is a
   reverse-geocoded name (OSM Nominatim, city/region level) for the
   centre of the drawn box. Geocoding failures are silent: the name is
   simply omitted.
   - PNG/JPG save the stretched/colour-mapped *display* pixels, cropped to
     valid data. No georeferencing.
   - TIF saves the **raw** reflectance DN (`rgb`/`single`) or index values
     (`index`) — vmin/vmax/gamma/colormap are display-only and never baked
     into it — as a georeferenced GeoTIFF (WGS-84 tie point + pixel scale
     computed from the crop's sub-bbox, via geotiff.js's `writeArrayBuffer`),
     3-band for `rgb`, 1-band for `single`/`index`.
     - `rgb`/`single` are written as **uint16**, the same sample type the
       source Sentinel-2 COGs use. Masked-out pixels are `0` (reusing raw
       DN's own nodata convention) with a `GDAL_NODATA: '0'` tag. Values are
       rounded and clamped into `[0, 65535]` before writing, since a
       `Uint16Array` assignment truncates and wraps rather than doing
       either of those.
     - `index` stays **float32** — its values (e.g. NDVI's -1..1) can't be
       represented as uint16 — with masked-out pixels as `NaN` and a
       `GDAL_NODATA: 'nan'` tag, since reusing `0` there would be wrong (an
       index value of exactly 0 is real data).
     - It is **not** a tiled/overview Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF — geotiff.js's
       writer has no tiling/overview support, only flat single-strip TIFFs;
       see the open question in the PR/commit that introduced this if that
       changes.

## Data handling rules

- **Multi-COG same-day mosaic**: all scenes from the selected day that
  intersect the box are merged. On overlap, keep the brighter pixel
  (larger r+g+b) to heal resampled nodata seams at scene edges.
  - Each item is placed into the output canvas by a true **per-pixel
    warp** (`warpItemInto()` in `export.js`, matching how odc-loader's RIO
    driver ultimately calls `rasterio.warp.reproject()`): for every
    candidate destination pixel, reproject its centre into the item's UTM
    CRS and bilinearly sample the item's own pixel grid there. Each item
    is read once per band into a dense grid (`readSourceGrid()` — a plain
    windowed read, no placement) at roughly the output's pixel density
    (using overviews); the warp step is what maps it onto the shared
    WGS-84 canvas, regardless of what UTM zone it's in.
  - This *isn't* optional precision — placing by a single affine derived
    from a window's corner points (whether corners in the item's own CRS,
    or corners un-projected back to WGS-84) only holds up within one UTM
    zone, because it assumes the CRS-to-CRS transform is uniform
    (translate + scale, no rotation/shear) across the whole window. Real
    UTM-to-UTM transforms have grid convergence that varies continuously
    with position, so a large enough window straddling a zone boundary
    visibly seams and shears under any corner-derived affine. Per-pixel
    reprojection is the only approach that stays correct there.
- **Use overviews**: read at a reasonable output resolution (target width
  default 1000 px, user adjustable), never full native resolution of a
  large area by default. The Area panel's output-size slider always reaches
  exactly the box's native pixel width (10 m/px) at its top end — its
  min/max/step are computed by `sliderRange()` (`overviews.js`), which
  shifts the slider's `min` up (by less than one step) rather than
  rounding native max down to the nearest step, since a range input can
  only be dragged all the way to `max` if `(max - min)` is an exact
  multiple of `step`. When native resolution doesn't clear the slider's
  floor by at least one step, there's genuinely only one achievable size
  (native itself), so `sliderRange()` returns `collapsed: true` and the
  Area panel renders the slider disabled and pinned to the right (100%)
  rather than at an arbitrary/left-biased position.
- **Range reads only**: compute pixel windows from the COG geotransform;
  never fetch whole files.
- **Size warning**: before fetching, show an estimated download size
  ("fetches ~X MB" - raw fetch traffic, not output file size) with a
  soft-warning tier, and a hard limit of 10,000 km² for the drawn box.
- **Cache keying**: the scene cache key includes day, bbox, target width,
  vizMode, the active bands for that mode, and the contributing item IDs, so
  any change that alters the mosaic (including cloud-filter changes)
  triggers a refetch.
- If the selected day disappears from new search results, clear the
  selection and preview.

## Map

- MapLibre GL with two MapTiler basemaps (`BASEMAPS` in `map.js`) — the
  dark dataviz style (default, button reads "MAP") and satellite imagery
  (button reads "SAT") — toggled via a compact button next to the zoom
  controls (`createToggleControl()`, a small reusable button showing
  *current* state, also used for the preview-visibility button below).
  Falls back to OSM raster on style error (e.g. local dev where the
  MapTiler key is rejected).
  - `map.setStyle()` wipes any source/layer not defined in the new style's
    own JSON — i.e. everything this app adds itself (footprints, drawn
    box, preview overlay). These re-add themselves on `'style.load'`
    (fires on every style change, unlike `'load'`, which fires once ever)
    so switching basemap never loses the current box/preview.
- A second toggle button (same style) reads "ON"/"OFF" for whether the
  preview overlay is currently shown, and shows/hides it without
  discarding the cached fetch — a `visibility` layout-property flip, not a
  re-render or re-fetch. Local UI state only, not part of the URL.
- Default view: whole world (center [0, 20], zoom 1).
- STAC footprints always drawn (logo blue #3474c7); when a box is drawn
  and a day is selected, only that day's footprints show, highlighted in
  gold (#fbc27b). Drawn box is white.
- The maplibre worker must be bundled self-contained
  (`?worker&url` import + `setWorkerUrl`) or GeoJSON layers silently
  break in production.
- Camera position (zoom/lat/lng) lives in the URL **hash** via MapLibre's
  own `hash: true` — not something this app's code manages.

## Shareable URL

- Everything else shareable lives in the URL's **query string** (kept
  independent of the hash above), read/written via pure functions in
  `url-state.js` (`parseParams`/`buildParams` — no `location`/`history`
  access there, so they're plain to unit test; `main.js` supplies the
  actual browser globals):
  - `bbox` — drawn box, `west,south,east,north`.
  - `datetime` — `<dateFrom>/<dateTo>`, the same ISO interval shape the
    STAC search itself sends.
  - `cloud_cover_max`, `selected_datetime` (the selected day), `width`
    (target output width), `basemap` (which `BASEMAPS` entry).
  - `visualise_settings` — one JSON blob: `preset`, `vizMode`, `bands`,
    `singleBand`, `indexBands`, `viz` (vmin/vmax/gamma/colormap/
    colormapReversed/format).
- Restored on load (a `bbox` also redraws the box outline via
  `draw.setBbox()`, reusing the exact same `onDrawnBbox` path a real
  drag/click takes — no separate restore logic to keep in sync; `basemap`
  is applied before the map is even constructed, since it's needed for
  the initial style). Written back on every relevant state change,
  debounced 400ms so continuous interactions (slider drags) don't spam
  the address bar; uses `history.replaceState`, never `pushState`, so it
  doesn't pollute the back button.
- Not included: the collection (`sentinel-2-l2a` — hardcoded, no UI to
  change it), camera position (already in the hash, see above), and the
  preview-visibility toggle (ephemeral display state, not shareable).

## UI

- Sidebar panels in order: Search, Area, Days, Visualise, Export, Status.
  No sidebar preview image (map overlay only). Visualise combines band/index
  selection and the Look sliders in one panel (preset dropdown, band
  pickers, colour map, then vmin/vmax/gamma) since they're one coherent
  "how the pixels are computed and shown" concern.
- Panels use a paint-key render guard so progress updates never rebuild
  DOM mid-interaction (sliders, dropdowns). Fetch progress renders inside
  the loading day's own row in the Days list (a thin bar under that day's
  subtitle), not as a separate block above the list — that used to bump
  every row up/down each time a fetch started or finished.
- Auspatious brand theme: Space Grotesk headings (uppercase, wide
  tracking), Inclusive Sans body, ausblue #194bfd accent, gold #fbc27b
  secondary, #232323 dark panels, rounded corners, Auspatious favicon.
- Header: app name "Cogniscient", tagline, "Built with ❤️ by Auspatious"
  link, and a link to GitHub issues.

## Architecture and deployment

- 100% client-side, no backend. Vite build, plain JS, small modules:
  store (state.js) + controller (main.js) + panels (src/ui/).
- Unit tests (vitest, `npm test`) cover the pure logic modules: mosaic
  grouping/coverage, output-size geometry, size estimates, geocode slugify,
  UTM reprojection, mosaic merge/crop math, the NDVI/NDBI-style normalized-
  difference calculation, and a real read-back round trip of the GeoTIFF
  writer. GitHub Actions runs tests + build on every push/PR.
- Unexpected runtime errors (uncaught exceptions, unhandled promise
  rejections) are surfaced in the Status panel via `log.err`, not just the
  console.
- Deployed as Cloudflare Workers static assets (worker name
  `image-exporter`, do not rename - the cogniscient.auspatious.com route
  depends on it). Deploy: `npm run build && npx wrangler deploy`.
- Live at https://cogniscient.auspatious.com/.
